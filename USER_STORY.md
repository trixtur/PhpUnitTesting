# FizzBuzz User Story
## Description
As a user of the FizzBuzz system I would like to know if numbers are divisible by the number 3 or the number 5 or both. If they are not I would like the number to be displayed.

In order for me to know that the number is divisible by the number 3 I would like the word "Fizz" to be displayed. Also in order for me to know if the number is divisible by 5 I would like to see the word "Buzz". I do not need to see the numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5.

## User Acceptance Criteria
1. If a number is not divisible by the number 3 or the number 5 it should simply be printed.
1. If a number is divisible by 3 it should print the word "Fizz".
1. If a number is divisible by 5 it should print the word "Buzz".

## Additional Considerations
1. If a number is by both I would like to know that as well. It should not simply print "Fizz" or "Buzz" just because the 3 or the 5 condition was checked first.
